Shopping Cart App

This is my shopping cart app, prompted by a mock interview challenge given by Generation Australia. It makes use of exclusively React, allowing me to hone my skills and practice industry-standard syntax and structure.

----------- Installation -------------- This app will require use of your local terminal. You will need both Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), and npm (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) in order to run it successfully.

Once these two programs are installed, you should navigate to the directory where you would like to install the app. Once there, copy the address of this GitHub repository, and issue the command 'git clone (GitHub repository address)' in your terminal. This will locally copy all of the repository files in your chosen directory. Navigate inside the repository in your terminal, and once you are in the app folder, you can issue the command 'npm start' to begin running the app. This command may take some time to execute, but once running it will open your favourite browser with a window showing the app's output.
